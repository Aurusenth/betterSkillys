# betterSkillys.
I made this project in the hopes of it being a better version of *Skilly's 7.0* that he put out several years ago. While the fact it's still based off of NR-CORE is a little spiffy, it can handle 200 concurrent players without much issue. I am using **TK-Reborn** by *Slendergo* as a base, stripping down all custom content with some exceptions. These exceptions include the Marketplace and Potion Storage, and have been revised as off me writing this. Features like over-maxing *(16/16)* and talismans have been removed, though. The end-goal is to get the existing content *(as in dungeons)* on-par with **prod. version X18.0.0**. So far I have added Mountain Temple, and Killer Bee Nest, with plans of adding the Hive and Nest dungeons. This source does not come without it's issues, but I will iron out the most detrimenting ones before an official release. **All other items/assets are up to date with RotMG 1.0.4.0**. *(the last available RotMG flash client)*
