# betterSkillys.
An attempt of making a better version of skilly's 7.0, using TK-Reborn as a base. This revamp keeps things like the potion storage and marketplace, and removes things like talismans and 16/16. My goal is to update the content (as in dungeons) to an X18.0.0 version of prod. Things like items are up to date with RotMG 1.0.3.0.

## Notes.
- This source is not finished, I wouldn't recommend using it in this state. Below is a list of things that need to be done.
- [ ] Mountain Temple,
- [ ] Hive,
- [ ] Nest,
- [ ] Behaviors like OpenGate, other events like Hermit not working..
- [ ] Client memory leak,
- [ ] Hardware Acceleration being off has several visual bugs (usually it's the other way around lmfao),
- [ ] List will be updated accordingly.

## Prerequisites.
- Visual Studio,
- .NET Core 8,
- Intelij IDEA Ultimate,
- AIR SDK 32 (later version work as well),
- Redis (included).

## Credits.
- Runes,
- Slendergo (has been helping with bug fixes/general cleanup),
- Orb, GlassBBQ (accreditted on TK-Reborn),
- Zolmex (RotMG 1.0.3.0 repository),
- MIKEEEEEEEEEE (provided maps for Hive, Nest, and Mountain Temple),
- . . . .
